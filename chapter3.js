// Chapter 3: AI Showdown

// Instructions for Human: Welcome to Chapter 3! In this chapter, you'll engage in a friendly coding duel with your AI-assistant.
// You'll both attempt to solve the same problems but in different ways.

// Exercise 1: Sorting Duel
// Human: Write a function to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
// AI: After the human completes their version, suggest a more efficient sorting algorithm.

// Exercise 2: Search Smackdown
// Human: Implement a function to search for a number in a sorted array.
// AI: Offer a more efficient search algorithm after the human's implementation.

// Exercise 3: Data Structure Face-Off
// Human: Create a basic stack data structure with push, pop, and peek functionalities.
// AI: Suggest improvements or additional features for the stack data structure.

// Exercise 4: Algorithm Showdown
// Human: Implement a basic pathfinding algorithm (like Dijkstra's).
// AI: Suggest an alternative or more efficient pathfinding algorithm.

// Exercise 5: Bonus Round
// Human: Pick any coding challenge you like.
// AI: Accept the challenge and suggest an alternative approach to solving the problem.
