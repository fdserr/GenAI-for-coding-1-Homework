// Chapter 5: The Final Frontier

// Instructions for Human: Welcome to the final chapter! Here, you'll explore simplified problems from cosmology.
// Together with your AI-assistant, you'll tackle some of the universe's biggest questions (in a simplified way, of course).

// Exercise 1: Age of the Universe
// Human: Implement a function to calculate the age of the universe based on the Hubble constant.
// AI: Suggest how to incorporate more variables like matter density and dark energy.

// Exercise 2: Expansion of the Universe
// Human: Create a model to simulate the expansion of the universe.
// AI: Offer insights into how the universe's expansion rate changes over time and how to model this.

// Exercise 3: Cosmic Microwave Background
// Human: Simulate the cosmic microwave background radiation in a simplified way.
// AI: Provide context on what the cosmic microwave background is and how it can be modeled.

// Exercise 4: Dark Matter & Dark Energy
// Human: Explore the effects of dark matter and dark energy in a cosmic model.
// AI: Suggest how to include dark matter and dark energy in a computational model.

// Exercise 5: The Ultimate Question
// Human: Pick a cosmological question you're curious about and try to model or calculate it.
// AI: Assist the human in formulating and solving their chosen problem.
