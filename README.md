# GenAI for Coding (I)

This is a Javascript project made up of several chapters each 
containing different exercises. You can run any chapter's exercises 
by modifying the `index.js` file.

## How to run a chapter
To run a specific chapter:
1. Open the `index.js` file.
2. Uncomment the specific `chapter()` function call you want to run.

E.g., to run chapter1, remove double slashes before `chapter1();`.
Then edit the `chapterX.js` file, following the instructions therein.
