// Chapter 1: Code Summoning

// Instructions for Human: Welcome to the first chapter! Your first task is to write a simple "Hello, World!" function.
// After that, you and your AI-assistant will work together to optimize it and add more features.

// Exercise 1: Hello, World!
// Human: Write a function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// AI: If the human struggles, suggest a straightforward way to implement this function.

// Exercise 2: Function Optimization
// Human: Now, try to optimize the function by making it reusable for different greeting messages.
// AI: Suggest how to make the function more generic, so it can be used for various greetings.

// Exercise 3: Add Features
// Human: Add a feature to the function that allows it to print the greeting multiple times.
// AI: Offer a way to make the function more feature-rich, for example by adding loop functionality.
